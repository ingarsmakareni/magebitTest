# magebitTest

Using xampp (enabling Apache and MySQL), insert the Magebit folder in xampp/htdocs folder. After that just open in browser localhost/magebit/ and it will open index.html file(main file). All actions required can be done from there, except the PHP/MySQL task part. That can be open by going to localhost/magebit/show_data.php
Previously said that i could not complete the delete, filter and search functions. In this project it is possible(except search), i made the delete email function (it works just by clicking on user desired email), filter function also works by clicking the buttons above the table (automatically adds buttons if new email providers are provided). I could not finish the search function, had difficulties with this function, it is a thing to work on for me.
